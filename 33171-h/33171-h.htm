<span class="i0">Bunched bells of the blush pomegranate, to fix<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At your throat ... six drops of fire they are....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will you look where the moon and its following star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise silvery over yon meadow ricks?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Within the murmuring, sunny<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And here alone I sit and it is so!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O vales and hills! O valley lands and knobs!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">None that my heart may know!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wearying sameness!&mdash;yet this thing is so!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thing is so, and still the waters flow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sun and wind, and yet this thing is so!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, at this culvert's mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shadowy water, flowing towards the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems deepest, stagnant-stayed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What is there yonder that makes me afraid?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my own self afraid?&mdash;what is't below?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What power draws me to the striate stream?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What evil or what dream?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me, dropping pebbles in the quiet wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That echoes, strange as music in a cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hollow and thin; vibrating in the shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sound of tears&mdash;the shadow of some woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ailing phantom that will not be laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since this is so, since this sad thing is so.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, in the water, how the lank green grass<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their rock-born melodies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there, and there one sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wide-belled mallow, as within a glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long-pistiled, leaning o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The root-contorted shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if its own pink image it would kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the tangled wild-potato vine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts conical blossoms, each a cup of wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As pale as moonlight is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there tall gipsy lilies, all a-sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their savage, coppery faces, fierce of hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull purple-streaked, bend in inverted view.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the stream around those rushes creeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dragon-fly, in endless error, keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sewing the pale gold gown of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tangled stitches of a burning blue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its brilliant body seems a needle fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thread of azure ray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But here below me where my pensive shade<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of bursting bubbles in the spawny ooze.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All flowers here refuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grow or blossom; beauties, too, are few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That haunt its depths: no glittering minnows braid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its languid crystal; and no gravels strew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I shrink from my own eyes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To bask its spotted body, coiling numb.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first it seemed a prism on the grail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bubble's prism yonder; then a trail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angled sparkle in a shadow, swayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frog-like through deeps, to crouch a flaccid, pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Squat bulk below.... Reflected trees and skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breeze-blown clouds that lounge at sunny loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seem in its stolid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep down&mdash;the dim disguise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of something ghoulish there, whose features fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then come again in rhythmic waviness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms like tentacles that seem to press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up towards me. Limbs that writhe, and fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clench&mdash;tough limbs, that twist and cross<br /></span>

<h3>POEMS OF THE TOWN</h3>
<h4>By ERNEST McGAFFEY</h4>


<h5>16 mo. Flexible Leather. $1.25</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The following are but a few extracts from many
reviews received on <i>Poems of the Town</i>. Among
this chorus of praise there has not been one dissenting
voice.</p>

<p>"For terse English, for picturesque and appropriate
imagery, for keen and faithful portraiture
Mr. McGaffey has no superior. And there will
be many to say that this book entitles him to recognition
as the interpreter of his age."&mdash;<i>Chicago
Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>"It is doubtful if any American poet has written
a finer, more humane, more nobly and righteously
wrathful outburst against the maladies of
civilization than the poem in this collection entitled
<i>Laocoon of the Town</i>."&mdash;<i>St. Louis Mirror.</i></p>

<p>"His lyrics have that touch of universality
which distinguishes true poetry from mere verse.
It is not too much to say that <i>Poems of the Town</i>
are certain to take a place among the best examples
of American poetry."&mdash;<i>Editorial Chicago Chronicle.</i></p>

<h3>IRISH MIST AND SUNSHINE</h3>

<h4>BALLADS AND LYRICS BY</h4>

<h4>REV. JAMES B. DOLLARD<br />
(Sliav-na-mon)</h4>

<h5>With an introduction by William O'Brien, M. P.
With frontispiece.  Small quarto.
Cloth ornamental.  $1.50</h5>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This is a book of ringing Irish ballads that will
stir the heart of every lover of true poetry. "Here
and there a verse may be as frankly unadorned as
the peasant cabins themselves in their homely
cloaks of thatch, but every line rings true to life
and home and with the tone, as heartmoving as
the Angelus which holds Millet's peasants in its
spell," from Mr. O'Brien's introduction.</p>

<p>"Father Dollard's ballads have all the fire and
dash of Kipling's, with a firmer poetic touch"
says Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to describe adequately the
surpassing charm of this book. We can say simply
that it will appeal to every lover of nature
who sees in her manifold beauties the living
glories of the work of God.</p>

<p>No one can write more beautiful or sparkling
prose than Mrs. Spofford and never has she been
so absolutely charming as in <i>Four Days of God</i>.</p>
